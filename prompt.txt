Prompting Guidelines


Specify the Learning Objective: Clearly state the educational goal or the specific concept you'd like the lesson plan or activity to address. For example, "I need a lesson plan focused on the water cycle for 8-year-olds."


Describe the Student's Learning Profile: Include details about the student's age, grade level, learning style (e.g., visual, auditory, kinesthetic), and any other relevant information that can help tailor the response to their needs.




Mention Desired Outcomes: Explain what you hope the student will achieve by the end of the lesson or activity. This helps in creating assignments that are aligned with your educational goals.




Indicate Any Constraints: If there are specific requirements or limitations (time constraints, resources available, etc.), mentioning these can help tailor suggestions that are feasible and practical.


Request for Resources, If Needed: If you're looking for specific resources (e.g., age-appropriate reading materials, online tools, etc.), please specify this in your request.
